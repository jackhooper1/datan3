#### Aims of the module

This is a fourth module in the data analysis in social science series. In the Introduction to Social Data you learned the basics of descriptive statistics and R. Data Analysis 1 introduced you to statistical inference. Data Analysis 2 covered linear regression analysis. In Data Analysis 3 we are not going to learn new statistical techniques, but will focus on how to apply the techniques you already know to the analysis of real-life data sets and how to produce good statistical reports.

This is a skill that you may need in a variety of jobs where data analytic expertise is required, such as market analysis, policy analysis in various fields, web analytics, data journalism, academic research, etc.

You already know how to use R to describe data and estimate simple statistical models. However, real-life data rarely come in the form of a perfectly formatted csv file ready for the analysis. The real life data sets often need to be reshaped, merged, recoded, aggregated and modified in various ways before you can even start your analysis. Unless you know how to do this you will not be able to conduct independent statistical analysis.

In this module we will use data from the Understanding Society, a large household panel study conducted in the UK. We will work with longitudinal data, which introduces a number of technical challenges.

We will use R, and you are expected to know the basics of data analysis in R already. The pre-requisites for this module are SSI1006 (former POL/SOC1041) and SSI2005 (former POL/SOC2077).

The only way to learn data analysis is to do data analysis. I will not be able to teach you this, but I can guide your independent learning. Even last year I used the "flipped classroom" model of teaching (meaning that you are expected to read and master the required material BEFORE you come to class) and with online learning this year this is even more relevant.

Every Monday I'll upload on ELE a video introducing new material, with links to readings and exercises. You will have a week to watch the video and do exercises. Then in our online class I will answer your questions and will work together on additional exercises.


#### Software

Please install the following software.

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (please update your distribution if already installed)
- [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (please update if already installed)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)

All this software is free. 

#### Attendance

This is a technical module, and it will require effort and time commitment from you. As with other technical skills, missing some initial bits means that you may not be able to catch up. Attendance in this module is crucial. If you do not attend classes you will not be able to do well in this module.

#### Assessment

The summative assessment for this module is a data report of 2,000 words (50% of your final mark) and an ELE test (50% of the mark).

The 90-minute ELE test will be conducted in week 11 (online, open book, timed) and will test your knowledge of the module content.

For the final data report you will conduct independent analysis of the Understanding Society data and produce a report of 2,000 words describing the results of your analysis. The deadline for the report is 27 April, 2pm. The marking criteria for data reports are the following: originality of approach, complexity of analysis, correctness of code, correctness of interpretations, knowledge of background literature, style and accuracy.

Formative assessment is optional and does not count towards your grade. For the formative assessment I will ask you to complete a 30-minute ELE test with questions similar to the summative test. You can also complete two data assignments on Github (more details on this later) to prepare you for doing the analysis for your data reports.
